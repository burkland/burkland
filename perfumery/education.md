# The Ultimate Perfumery Wiki
A place for fragrance newbies to find their footing. I also hope to do some data analysis and research on trends with the perfume industry. There are few moments in life where I have felt the passion I have now. Being a hobbyist of hobbies has led me down some wild venturs, but I truly believe perfumery and fragrance to be my future.

###### A Special Thanks
There are two posts that I copied a lot of data from: one for books, the other for... well everything else. I want to say thank you to [Basenotes](https://basenotes.com/articles/new-to-perfume-diy-start-here.3892/) and [Master-Classter](https://basenotes.com/threads/resource-archive-for-self-education-about-fragrance.252887/) for all the resources put fourth so far. I also want to thank [u/choleropteryx](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/2iub7s/list_of_books_on_perfume_making/) for the book list on perfume making! Looking at these threads fueled my curiosity to learn more. I hope that my augmentations are well received! Mostly just wanted to centralize and organize my findings with your alls.
